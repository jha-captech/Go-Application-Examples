# TODO

- [ ] each example needs to be self-contained and able to run on its own
- [ ] readme for each example explaining architecture and key decision points
  Reference [this](https://github.com/jha-captech/Go-Microservice-Template)
- [ ] docker file and docker compose for each example that includes a postgres db, api, and maybe
  cache.
- [ ] db migrations (flyway?)
- [ ] unit tests
- [ ] integration tests (maybe)

> Note: there will be a lot of duplicate code
